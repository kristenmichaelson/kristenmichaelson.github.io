There's no denying it-- there are *a lot* of satellites in orbit around the Earth. As we enter a new era of near-daily launches and mega-constellations, the danger of two satellites colliding in space is increasing. 

Earlier this year, I started thinking about how AI could help us predict future satellite collisions-- or, *conjunctions*. I began by simulating a set of 10 spacecraft in near-circular orbits. Each orbit has a slightly different altitude (± 1 km) and eccentricity, *e* ∈ [0.0, 0.001].
