I'm an Aerospace Engineer and Researcher passionate about making autonomous systems more autonomous. From self-driving cars to satellites in orbit, autonomous systems learn about their relationship to the world around them using sensors. 

In my dissertation work, I focused on ***data assimilation***. Data assimilation is the process of incorporating information from sensors into an estimate of the *state* of a dynamical system. An abbreviated version of my dissertation talk is available on YouTube.

Job Seeker Statement
======
I'm actively seeking an engineering role in the San Francisco Bay Area. If you're hiring in the areas of aerospace guidance, navigation and control (GNC), navigation, estimation, self-driving, or robotics, let's connect!

Featured Project: Automating Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment with AI
