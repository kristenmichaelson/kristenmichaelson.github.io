I'm an Aerospace Engineer and Researcher passionate about making autonomous systems more autonomous. From self-driving cars to satellites in orbit, autonomous systems learn about their relationship to the world around them using sensors. 

In my dissertation work, I focused on ***data assimilation***. Data assimilation is the process of incorporating information from sensors into an estimate of the *state* of a dynamical system. Many of my research papers are available [online](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sxHDUVQAAAAJ). 

Current Role
======
I'm a Navigation Engineer at [Xona Space Systems](https://xonaspace.com)! 

Featured Project: [Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment with AI](https://kristenmichaelson.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)

How can we use AI to predict when two satellites will get too close for comfort?
